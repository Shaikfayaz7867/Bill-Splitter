This is a placeholder. For a proper PNG favicon, please:

1. Use an online SVG to PNG converter with the SVG content from favicon.svg
2. Save the resulting PNG file as favicon.png in the frontend/public directory
3. Or use any cash/money icon in blue color that matches your branding

Alternatively, you can just rely on the SVG favicon, which is supported by all modern browsers.
